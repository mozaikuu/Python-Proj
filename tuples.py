#tuples are like lists data structures that are immutable 
coords = [(4, 5)] #list of tuples   list=[]  tuple=()
print(coords[0]) # prints the first element of the tuple
print(coords[1]) # prints the second element of the tuple
print(coords[-1]) # prints the last element of the tuple    
print(coords[-2]) # prints the second to last element of the tuple
